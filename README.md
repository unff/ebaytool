# Ebaytool
Intended for use as a tool to allow eBay sellers with items stuck in the Inventory API to actually see what is there.

## TODO
- [ ] Implement eBay's OAUTH for tokens
- [x] add ngx-store for LocalStorage and SharedStorage decorators
- [ ] set up main container for header and nav with the touer outlet
- [ ] add datagrid for items that eventually come back
- [ ] move configs to ebay.auth


## NOTES
ebayAuth: configs go in, tokens come out, might need to pass a URL for endpoints as well.
